# also learned about process groups when I first booted and discovered that pid1 didn’t appear in htop.
# it turns out that htop hides kernel threads by default, and if you don’t do anything, s6 is still in

# which in this case is 1.
# s6-setsid -> s6-setsid: warning: unable to setsid: Operation not permitted
